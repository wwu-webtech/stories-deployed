          <p class="credits">
            The English Department at Western Washington University has supported Stories Deployed: The
            Veteran Chronicles since it began as a reading series in 2012, and this year in print form. We are
            deeply grateful for this ongoing support. This project was also funded by the
            Dean’s Fund for Excellence in the College of Humanities and Social Sciences. Thanks to Dean Paqui
            Paredes Mendez for understanding how much this means to Western veterans, alumni veterans,
            and veterans in the larger community. We are also grateful to the Office of Research and Sponsored
            Programs for deeming this project worthy of a grant. We’d also like to thank the WWU Veterans
            Services Office, because everyone there has always been willing to pitch in and lend a hand. Lastly,
            thanks to the Red Badge Project of Seattle for sponsoring many of the workshops in which this writing
            was produced.

            Jesse Atkins aptly named this storytelling performance by veterans. When we met, we were two people with similar feelings about the disconnect between Main Street and the military. Because my father was a captain in the Army, I understood what was happening in my classrooms after 9/11 when my students who were National Guard or Military Reservists disappeared, while many in their cohort didn’t seem to be aware of what was going on. As a teacher of writing, I was attending conferences where I learned about a movement among writers to share storytelling techniques with veterans so that they could give voice to their experiences. Operation Homecoming was the first and largest, funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities, but then came The Veterans Writing Project, Warrior Writers, and the Red Badge Project. So I went to find Jesse Atkins, who was then the Veterans Outreach Coordinator, and I learned that he had a love of writing that had started when he was a submariner, or “bubblehead,” as he would say. We decided to hold free writing workshops in the late afternoon on campus to see if we could get a group going. Only one person came: the enthusiastic Tsonsera Rhoades, God bless her. Jesse was undeterred, optimistic even. I asked him, “Where do campus veterans hang out?”
          </p>

          <p>
            He told me, “Folks like to gather at the VFW on Friday nights to eat pizza and drink beer.”
          </p>

          <p>
            “So, let’s go there,” I said. He agreed and we made up flyers. I also reached out to the writing group at the Bellingham Veterans Center, and they came down to share some of their work. Most of them were Vietnam Vets, and they wrote stories that could curl your hair, stories that emboldened the younger people who were mostly veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. There were some intense exchanges, and I learned not to get in the way when tough things needed to surface. I also learned I could trust vets to show up for each other powerfully, unfailingly. And that nobody has a darker sense of humor than a vet. Eventually, we moved to Saturday workshops, and I actually got some formal training from the Red Badge Project, though the vets themselves were my best teachers and never seemed to mind when I was flying by the seat of my pants.
          </p>

            Mostly, I am humbled by the quality of the writing they produced over the eight years we did this. The essays, poems, and stories in this book defy expectation. When you read this collection, you will learn what it’s like to volunteer in an Iraqi hospital after a bombing; what it’s like to guard the border between Egypt and Israel as part of a multi-national peacekeeping force; what’s it like to be a gay female soldier in a strip club in the Philippines; what it’s like to lose more of your company stateside than in Afghanistan; what’s it like to survive a firefight, be it in Vietnam or Afghanistan; and what’s it like to come home and attend college after combat. Many veterans will tell you that returning is the hardest part. Native American cultures understand the importance of ceremony as a way of helping the warrior to return. In some cultures, the soldier isn’t considered truly home until the community has heard his or her stories. Stories Deployed: The Veteran Chronicles was founded to recognize this need. Given that only 1% of the population makes up our volunteer army, most of us don’t know what we mean when we say, “Thank you for your service.” We are just not aware of what that might entail. And that’s a shame. I hope your respect is deepened by reading the stories herein. It has been an honor to publish them.

          <h2>The Gettysburg Address: A Walk in the Park</h2>
          <p class="tagline">by Stephen Allison</p>
          <p>
            She had red hair, long red hair with the smallest of curls at the ends. And she had this feather, like from a peacock or something, and she was moving it ever so lightly across my forehead and around and down my neck. She’d follow a path down around to my lower back and work her way toward my feet, go in between my toes and swirl this feather back up my legs. She knew exactly what she was doing. God, please let this last all night!
          </p>
          <p>
            One knows long before sunrise what kind of day it’s going to be in the desert of northern Africa. The Sinai mornings come slow and deliberate like a string of camels creeping over the mountains through the fog a hundred miles away. Like a flunky doing mail call for those unknown to him, morning is indifferent. Laden with parcels that can make or break someone’s day, it is passionate only about its mission of heralding the new day. With each morning come these parcels that contain both the predicted and the unexpected.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are the biting flies that come relentlessly in search of moisture in order to sustain their life. Mercilessly, they target the inside of the nostrils, wriggling and absorbing as they go. They seek soaked armpits, sweatbands, and dozens will cover a canteen when even a few drops of water are spilled. Best described as ruthless are the tactics employed by these black, buzzing, and biting monsters. They heed no clock, ignore all weather, and are ever present. They are skilled searchers and rarely give up until moisture is found. And there is the second largest arachnid on the continent, the camel spider, who, while the victim sleeps, will nibble and gnaw unobtrusively and create a necrotic hole bigger than a half-dollar in minutes. Wandering bands of nomadic Bedouins, while native to this land for thousands of years, still fall prey to these silent, agile, hairy beasts who weigh as much as an ounce. And so will all who fail to obey the first law of this land: Keep Your Head on a Swivel, Stay alert, Stay Alive.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some would ask which is more draining on a person whose goal is to stay alert and alive in this the harshest of environments on earth: the physical, emotional, or psychological aspects of survival? Which, if any, has precedence? There is no correct answer unless one responds with “It depends.” One’s head must be on that swivel and one must be constantly aware. Biting flies and spiders the size of a baseball are one thing, but there are other issues with which to contend.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are pitfalls that are even worse waiting for the uninitiated or careless who don’t realize their lives hang by a hair. The desert environment, while truly indifferent, is capable of being kind as well as wicked. It can sustain and nourish certain lives while it disables and exterminates others. It possesses no conscious desire to acquiesce, to give in, or to favor. Then there are man-made dangers as well, and unlike creatures that inhabit the desert these dangers are unpredictable.

            “MOFO”, “Wally World”, and “The World’s Biggest Ashtray” are a few of the pet names given to a particular geographic location in the northern Sinai. It is, in area, one mile by one mile and home to small components of military personnel from eleven different nations. The firebase is bounded by a perimeter of steel reinforced fencing, has manned guard towers with 50-caliber machine guns every 300 yards, and there is only one way in or out. The primary mission of soldiers at Wally World is to patrol and maintain security of the border between Egypt and Israel. Each national contingent has a unique mission, whether it be within the walls or out, that supports the primary mission. There are French pilots, British administrators, and Canadian and Dutch communication specialists and military police. The job of the infantry falls to Colombia, the United States, Fiji, New Zealand, and Australia. Uruguay and Norway provide sailors to sweep the Red Sea of ancient and not so ancient mines. The true name of this elite force is the Multi-National Peace-Keeping Force and Observers, called MFO for short, and the proper name for its location is El Gorah, Sinai, Egypt.
          </p>
          <p>
            From June 1988 until June 1989 I was assigned to the MFO. The idea that one can take time to learn about the predictable and unexpected in this barren tan wasteland remains questionable at best. On July 17, 1988 after being on the ground for only a month and a half, I was chosen by fate to participate in a life-changing experience along with four other soldiers that made biting flies and spiders pale by comparison.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our five-man patrol had been in operation for some seven days. We were 75 kilometers from any support and were on a well established patrol route that allowed reconnaissance to either side of the border. As senior man I had the responsibility of making sure everyone was up and ready to move at the first hint of daylight, so I was usually awake before anyone else. I clearly remember on this particular morning fighting with the creeping heat, arguing and losing the fight about waking, and how disappointed I was when I realized that the girl with the feather was not a girl with a feather. Shit!
          </p>
          <p>
            It had been a dream. The feather turned out to be sweat. I should have known. As the sweat pooled in my eye sockets, it created miniature lakes for biting flies to swim in. It ran down the middle of my back and it dripped off my ear lobes, and when I finally realized that she and her feather were gone I started feeling sorry for myself. Then I had to laugh. I should have known. I wanted to spend more time with this woman with red hair who seemed so real. But our morning had come, and there was business to take care of. I remember thinking, hoping, that she’d be back.
          </p>
          <p>
            My head had been on a swivel for many years by the time I got to the Sinai, and I had learned many lessons on how to function in different environments. To sleep, we would place cotton gauze in our ears and nose then cover our mouths with a surgical mask. This was a nice little trick and it worked to keep the biting flies from entering our noses, mouths, or ears but it did not keep them from drinking. It was a small victory but a victory of a psychological sense is just as worthy of praise like any other. On this morning I removed the sweat soaked cotton gauze from my ears and nose and untied the surgical mask that covered my mouth. Then I scraped the bodies of flies that had gotten under the mask and had passed from this life to another sometime during the night. There would be plenty of time later to change the sweat soaked socks of the evening for drier and more comfy ones. We would tie the wet socks on our ammunition pouches to dry during the day. This was all just part of being in this barren hot and dry wasteland.
          </p>
          <p>
            One can only experience, tolerate, and berate the environment when it’s 125  so early in the morning. With the heat, the ever present flies, and the spiders that you know are creeping along your arms and legs when sleeping, it becomes easy to get distracted and stressed. Gotta laugh because if you start crying you may never be able to stop. The Godsend was that the patrol was only ten days long and then you got to take a shower and sit on a real shitter. And we had only three days to go. But still, this environment and the job that needed to be done all worked like a system of gears and pulleys as it pulled, cranked, screeched, and devoured one’s energy and will.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chow was done and our team of five was awaiting the helicopter that would bring us fresh water and more food. Chow or grub, who knows where these pet names for food came from, consisted of three year old MREs (meals, ready to eat), which were the latest in Army rations. Guaranteed to last forever, and I can attest to that fact, they were usually the focal point of morning bitching and griping by anyone and everyone. They were always FUBAR, a military acronym that stands for “fucked up beyond all reason”, and served only to fill an empty belly. We were also waiting for new batteries for our radio, the only link back to our fire base and the command center. We had three days to go on this patrol and had only several kilometers to cover during the remaining time so we were sitting sweet. We was cruisin’ on the downhill slope, we was next to go home to the showers!!!! And we were all ready to call the States when we got back to the fire base. We were happy little campers. I should have known.
          </p>
          <p>
            No one person heard it first, that dull thud, but we all saw the brown dust in the dawn light of early morning. Screams. Pitiful, high-pitched and frightening screams came from the cloud of brown dust less than twenty-five meters away. Specialist Billy McCarthy, while returning from relieving himself, had found a land mine and now portions of his twenty-three-year old body were lying about coloring the dawn brown sand with splashes of red.
          </p>
          <p>
            I got there first as the team medic placed a tourniquet on his left leg below his crotch and fired him up with two quarter grain amps of morphine. The pulsating flow of red blood ceased as it turned into a trickle. The blood curdling screams turned into whimpers after a third hit of morphine. The minutes that passed seemed to drag on endlessly. He knew he was dying. We all knew he dying.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Sarge, can you do me a small favor?” said Billy, blood oozing from his mouth, his face blackened from the explosion and smoke coming from his uniform.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Hooah,” says I. “Whatever you ask.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Sarge, can you say the Gettysburg Address for me? Come on man, it should be a walk in the park for a guy like you.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Like thunder exploding and resounding throughout the Grand Canyon, his death rattle, that gurgling, drowning sound that you hear about in movies, escaped. I don’t know why he asked me to do that, maybe it was the morphine.
          </p>
          <p>
            I often look forward to the girl with red hair visiting me again. The truth is that I would trade what does show up in my dreams sometimes for any girl. Feather or not. In my dreams now instead I’m given a chance to relive that morning, that day, with Billy and the team. And again I hear that dull thud and see brown sand settling. And again I fail. And again he dies. And again I don’t know a fucking thing about the Gettysburg Address. And again I feel feelings of such intense inadequacy and guilt that I pray to never sleep again, or to sleep forever, maybe in place of Billy.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a prayer that is prayed by all who have failed at a personal or significant task. The prayer is for another chance. But time travels in only one direction. Time does not offer absolution nor does it provide consideration for extenuating circumstances. The awful reality is that there is no chance to redo anything once it is done. For whatever good it does me, I now know the Gettysburg Address by heart. I swear at times I think I’ve awakened in the middle of the night mumbling it aloud. I won’t read it and I won’t even talk about it. I know that if I really want to hear or feel it I can just fall asleep.

            Browning killed himself. Blade Runner killed himself. Powell’s family won’t tell us what happened, but judging from what we learned about the circumstances in which he was found dead, he probably killed himself too. And those are just the ones I knew best. It’s bad, man. Almost every infantryman I know has already passed the point where suicide’s taken more friends than the Taliban. It doesn’t always come out of nowhere, but sometimes it does, and since I don’t fuck with Facebook, I’m usually one of the last to know.
          </p>
          <p style="width: 50%; margin: 12px auto;">
            ‘Hey killer, have you heard from Ginge lately? His ol lady messaged Me. Nobody can find him for a couple days now. Copy?’
          </p>
          <p>
            I called immediately. When it went straight to voicemail, I knew. He’d been prone to drinking benders in the past and I wanted to pretend it was that. But I knew.
          </p>
          <p>
            Still, if I’d been anywhere within a thousand miles, I might’ve taken off that night to go look for
            him. Instead, I resigned to the facts and resorted to going home and staring blankly at the ceiling,
            praying. When my phone went off at 2:00 am, it broke my heart, and I just lay there for a while, preparing
            myself before reaching over to see what it said.
          </p>
          <p style="width: 50%; margin: 12px auto;">
            ‘Ginge is down man. Don’t know what happened yet. Still waiting on word.’
          </p>
          <p>
            I couldn’t accept it. He’d been one of my best friends. The best man at my first wedding. There really isn’t another way to interpret what I’d read, but fuck if I didn’t look for one. Hoping on hope, I asked Froggy to lay it out as plainly as possible.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: right;">
            ‘What exactly do you know?’
          </p>
          <p style="width: 50%; margin: 12px auto;">
            ‘His ol lady messaged me and
            told me he died.’
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: right;">
            ‘Jesus man’

          <p style="width: 50%; margin: 12px auto;">

            ‘No problem, brother. I was
            supposed to keep it on the DL until
            his family made the announcement
            but I feel like he would’ve wanted
            us to know.’
          </p>
          <p>
            I didn’t cry, then. I didn’t do anything. According to my phone, I just sat there staring blankly at the closet, or whatever was in front of me, for the next six minutes.
          </p>
          <p style="width: 50%; margin: 12px auto;">
            ‘Suicide. Shot to the chest. Left
            a note. Don’t know what it says
            yet.’
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a beautiful funeral. Weapons Platoon showed up in force, plus a few of the other Kilo guys
            who’d been lucky enough to know him well. We all got to meet Klaus, the Green Beret that Ginge had
            idolized and told us so much about, and talk with his parents and uncles and sister and girlfriend and
            a lot of really great people who traded stories with us, confirming from different angles what we’d all
            come to learn about him over the years. In the chapel, the family’s pastor gave a heartfelt and comforting
            sermon to his mom and stepmom, and I guess the rest of us too, and his brothers and cousin
            had some really funny things to say about him. Apparently, Ginge had always been a terrible driver.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the ceremony at the cemetery was concluded, after the words had been said and we’d done
            our best to choke out the Marine Corps Hymn, Kilo Company had a little assembly, and the bottles
            and flasks started coming out of everywhere. It was like being back at the barracks, except everyone
            had a suit, a beard, and some of us even had a career.
          </p>
          <p>
            Among them: McLovin was getting looked at by the FBI. For recruitment, that is. Grizz had been
            the West Coast Director of a major cannabis corporation but broke off with them to start a business
            of his own. Bizzo was up in Montana working in a mine and raising kids, and Tom ran a business
            where he went around cleaning up crime scenes. His first day back from the funeral was a gunshot
            suicide. No bullshit. And fucking Voshell. That fucker was living in a van and bouncing between a
            bunch of different marinas to make a shit load of money doing underwater welding.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Wow, man. That’s badass.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “It’s alright. Nothing like throwing those rounds downrange though. But hey, you gotta give up on
            the wild life if you’re gonna have a real one. You know?”
          </p>
          <p>
            I smiled.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Logan never gave up. Last I heard, that motherfucker’s getting paid to jump out of planes.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Things got quiet.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Bro. Logan killed himself.”
          </p>

          <h2>American Djinn</h2>
          <p class="tagline">by Keith Fletcher</p>
          <p>
            One soldier shot the dog; another shot the wife. They’d just hit Karim’s compound. After the shooting, the soldiers scurried about gathering evidence, avoiding the dead wife on the floor, her head canoed and oozing red, an AK just out of reach of her pulseless palm. They ziptied the detainees and placed spray-painted goggles over their eyes. Scharff cut the fingers off the dead ones to run through biometrics later.
          </p>
          <p>
            The soldiers stepped off the objective, detainees in tow. The valley shown viridian in the monochromatic green moonlight of the night vision goggles. They slithered up the mountain in a staggered line of green optoelectronic dots, into the darkness above. When they got to the top of the ridge, they established a security perimeter around the HLZ.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scharff pulled out the ziplocked baggy of fingers. He had his interpreter, Atiq, run the digits over the biometrics device while he logged the entries.
          </p>
          <div class="medium photo right">
            <img src="src/img/keith_fletcher-1.jpg" alt="Sepia toned Keith in profile wearing fatigues and smoking a cigarette">
          </div>
          <p>
            “This is bad juju, man,” Atiq said, sighing.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It’s just a job.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Bro. It’s dead fingers, man. You get cursed for doing this kind of shit. The bad kind of curse, one that follows you to the grave man.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I thought you didn’t believe in that ‘superstitious shit’.”
          </p>
          <p>
            They finished, placed the fingers back in the bag and packed up the biometrics system. Captain Bert walked up to them. “Birds down in five mikes. You still got them fingers?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Yes Sir.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Let me see them.” Scharff pulled them out. Bert grabbed them out of his hand and looked them over. “That’s some sick shit.” He had a big grin on his face. “Good work.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “He’s a sick fuck, bro,” Atiq said, after Bert was out of earshot. The Captain was a real meat head, at five foot eight, with a swollen neck and arms that prohibited him from touching his back. As the sound of the approaching rotors echoed through the mountains, Scharff thought back to before the raid, when Bert had gathered the soldiers and launched into his pre-mission pep talk: “We few, we happy few, we band of brothers…” He thought the Shakespeare gave him that warrior poet edge, but for the most part, it only reified the soldiers’ belief that he was a real class-A douchebag. Throughout the battalion, his name had taken on the verb form of the grosser bodily functions. For instance: a soldier retiring to their jack shack might say “I’m going to go rub out a Bert.” A soldier going take a shit might say “I’m going to go drop a Bert.” There was an arched 12-inch-penis over the plywood doorway of a pisser, with BERT carved across the shaft, etching his name into the annals of FOB history.
          </p>
          <p>
            The helicopters touched down, the soldiers and detainees loaded up, and they lifted off. As they rose into the crisp mountain air, the dawn light slowly crept across the easterly peaks. Scharff peered out the window. The valley floors below were scattered with glacial till and ancient river rock over which flowed braided white capped streams. Across the valley, mountain peak after mountain peak thrust into the air like the exposed bone shards of a heap of amputated limbs, the torn flesh flopping down into jagged draws and ravines.
          </p>
          <p>
            They touched down at the FOB, offloaded, and took the detainees to the DHA. “Get a couple hours of shut eye. We’ll start Karim’s interrogation at ten. We only have 48 hours with him, before the Task Force picks him up.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Sounds good man.” Atiq took off in the direction of his hooch.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scharff made his way to the office. Jones was passed out over her keyboard. She woke when he shut the door. Scharff dropped his assault pack and removed his body armor and helmet. Jones was a SIGINT collector from Scharff’s unit. They’d established a mutual rapport over combining their intelligence to action targets. After a Reaper had dropped 500lb bomb on the first target they developed together, Jones had entered Scharff’s hooch and pushed him down into his bed. Now, they celebrated in such a manner each time they scratched a target off the JPEL list.
          </p>
          <p>
            “How was it?” Jones asked.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Good. We got him. You want to get some chow?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Sure.” They went to the chow hall and grabbed a table in the corner.
          </p>
          <p>
            “You alright?” Scharff asked.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Yeah. I’m just exhausted. I’m tired of this shit.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Yeah?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I either have to be a bitch or a slut, and I’m not a slut so I guess I’m just a stupid bitch.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “No, you’re not.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Yeah, not to you. You don’t get it.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Get what?” Scharff leaned in as Jones drank her coffee.
          </p>
          <p>
            “That dipshit in Ops was drooling all over me again, and I tore into his ass, and now everyone in Ops is pissed at me, like I’m a big, fat, snarling bitch and I’m sick and fucking tired of it.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “You want to get out of here? I’m not even hungry. I just came for the coffee.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Fuck it. Yeah. Let’s go celebrate. I’m sorry—I’m just tired.”
          </p>
          <p>
            They went back to the office and into the shura room. They lay on their backs on the wool Afghan rug. Jones rolled over on top of Scharff. Her thighs pressed down on top of his, locking him to the floor. He reached up to unzip her jacket and she slapped his hand off and punched him in the side of his face. “Hmph,” she almost laughed, when he winced. She unbuttoned his trousers.
          </p>
          <p>
            When they were done, they went out and lit up a smoke, and sat on the stoop.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Do you like it, what we do?” Scharff asked.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Yeah. Of course. I’m just tired of the Army.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I think I’m addicted.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Addicted to what?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I know it’s fucked up, but what we do, tracking people, hunting them. I’m addicted. There’s no replacement and—like, I know that we’re up to our necks in a river of blood,” Scharff let out a stream of smoke, “—but I’ve found my purpose and it’s this and sometimes I want to suck start my M9 and other times I want to dance naked and howl at the empty moon. It’s all fucked up in here,” Scharff said, jabbing his head. He and Jones had friends who’d tried to find alternatives—heroin, bank heists, serial killing, etcetera, etc.—and most were in prison, or dead. The ones who pretended like the addiction wasn’t there, like it was some switch they could just shut off, they weren’t any better off: two-parts booze, one-part broken marriage, and sprinkle with suicide to flavor. There was no replacement.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Jesus Christ, man. I’m checking you in to behavioral health when we get back stateside.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “You and me both.” Past the wall of the base, they could see the tan, rammed earth walls and roofs of the neighboring village. Poplar and olive trees grew between the buildings. The sweet smell of wood smoke wafted over the base walls. Beyond the earthen village, green terraces worked their way up the valley wall. They finished their cigarettes in silence.
          </p>
          <p>
            A couple of soldiers brought Karim into the interrogation booth. Atiq and Scharff were waiting for him. “Tsenge. Zama num Scharff de.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Karim stared at Scharff and Atiq.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I’m going to ask you questions about the insurgency. I don’t care who you are or what you’ve done. I’m not here to get a confession out of you,” Scharff said. Atiq translated. Scharff explained that he was Karim’s advocate, that he was there to defend him and in order for him to do that well, he needed to get to know him. They discussed Karim’s childhood on a small pistachio farm outside the provincial capital, his wives, Muska and Reshmina, and his children. They discussed the woes that faced Karim’s people. Karim was the provincial insurgent commander and Scharff had been developing his target packet for months. Karim was a family man and a folk hero, a real robin hood of the Hindu Kush sonofabitch, so Scharff had decided on a love of family/pride-and-ego-down interrogation approach. “Tell me about the insurgency, Karim. That’s something I can take to my boss. Help me prove that you want to cooperate. Meet me halfway. Do it for your people. Do it for your tribe. Do it for your family.” They’d been at it for hours.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Where is my family? Where are my children? Where are my wives? Why won’t you tell me how they are?” Atiq glanced at Scharff.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scharff pulled out a piece of paper from his folder and slid it face down across the table. Keeping his hand over the top and looking into Karim’s eyes, he said: “It isn’t pretty. I’m sorry.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Karim turned over the piece of paper. He shuddered. It was Reshmina’s dead body, head hollowed out, lying on the floor of his house from the raid the night before. He grabbed a handful of his hair with each hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            “This is your fault, Karim. Help me stop this from happening again.” Scharff grabbed the photo, then he and Atiq left the room.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Damn, bro,” Atiq said. “That was heavy.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Scharff lit a cigarette. The guard came in. “Well?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “We’re done for now. Take him outside the wall for the night and put him on his knees in front of a battle position, so they can keep an eye on him. Strip him down to his underwear. I want to leave him out there overnight—let his thoughts ferment.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Scharff turned in and fell into a deep, dreamful slumber. He was standing over the silhouette of a man sleeping in bed. The sheets were blue. He was envious of this man and his blue Egyptian threads and his down pillows. Towering over the body, Scharff slid his hand down and clasped his neck, gently first, then firmer and the sleeping man’s body jerked alive. The cartilage, tendon, and muscle squirmed under Scharff’s grip. Scharff started to slug away at the man’s face with his off hand, angry that he still couldn’t identify his victim. The sleeper started spitting and spraying blood and phlegm through his thin blue lips, into Scharff’s face. Then the sleeper relaxed, and his mouth opened gently, exposing his neat white teeth. Scharff looked closer and realized the sleeper’s face was his face.
          </p>
          <p style="width: 50%; margin: auto;">
            THWAP!
          </p>

            THWAP!
          </p>
          <p>
            Scharff jolted awake, threw on his body armor, and grabbed his rifle. The plywood door to his hooch was splintered across the floor and dark smoke shrouded the air. A 6-by-6 timber was on fire on the stoop. The battle positions were talking their guns back and forth, call and response, like Beethoven’s Fifth, the antiphony of war—
          </p>
          <p style="width: 50%; text-align: right;">

          <p>
            <span style="width: 80%; display: inline-block;"> </span> —it wasn’t right. They never got hit with small arms. It was the occasional stray rocket or mortar or recoilless rifle—never small arms. The 155 Howitzers were silent. Smoking sandbags were shredded, were littered everywhere, as if they’d been dropped from the sky like confetti. Scharff stepped over the burning timber. A soldier ran past: “The gun line’s down! They hit the AHA! Red Bayonet! Red Bayonet.” Scharff bolted through the alleyway outside his hooch, towards Jones’ sleeping quarters. He rounded the corner. A group of insurgents were pouring through a smoldering hole in the base wall. Karim stood in the midst of them, barking orders. Bert and a platoon of soldiers rounded the adjacent corner: “Once more, into the breach!” They had fixed their bayonets. The insurgents opened on them with a volley of RPG and PKM fire. The soldiers closed the distance and started to stab and shoot their way towards the hole in the wall. Scharff was too dumbfounded to look away.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Hey.” It was Jones. A bullet blew fragments of her cranium across the stucco wall next to Scharff. Scharff dropped to his knees next to her. He rubbed his hands across her body as if the friction might revive her. He dropped his armor and unclipped his helmet. He ran his fingers through her hair. Behind her, an insurgent with an SVEST ran into the TOC: Allahu Akbar! Dust and blood and bone fragments ripped out the doorway. He stripped off his clothes and rubbed her blood over his body. Across the way, Karim was slicing into Bert’s fat neck with a dull blade. A soldier next to Bert screamed Fuck You! as an insurgent stabbed into him with a bayonet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scharff reached up and held his head between his palms. He could smell Jone’s blood and taste her iron on his lips. It was still warm. He slid his hands over his lids and massaged his fingers over the pink fleshy part where the nose meets the eye. He gouged his fingers into each socket and clawed out his eyeballs.
          </p>
          <p>
            A hand gripped his shoulder. “Bro—we’ve got to get out of here.” Atiq helped him stand. They walked towards the insurgents, Scharff naked and eyeless. The insurgents lowered their weapons. Atiq and Scharff walked through the hole in the wall.
          </p>
          <p>
            Four men sat huddled, talking in a hushed tone near a fire pit. “He’s part lizard, part human. He dips his tail in village water and the children turn to stone,” one said. “No, you stupid donkey fucker. He’s a British soldier trying to find his way back to Kashmir,” said another. “Neishta,” said the third. “He’s a German Nazi looking for the source of the sun in the eastern slopes.” “You’re all wrong,” said the fourth man. “I’ve heard his howl. He’s a djinn looking for his eyeballs.”

          <p>
            I am quick to volunteer. I am desperate to find a way to feel more productive. That’s how I end up standing in the Iraqi ICU ward while deployed. It is merely a tent with hospital beds lining each side of it and people rushing around. Every bed is occupied but the patients in each one appear a little different. I had volunteered to help the staff, but with no real medical experience, I could only do a few things. So, I help bathe patients and change the bandages on their wounds. At the first bed, I can’t shake the need to hold the hand of its occupant. They, the staff, tell me that’s she’s five years old, but she’s so tiny that she barely looks to be two years old. She’s unconscious but I hold her hand anyway and intently watch the machine that’s helping her to breathe. There is a man in the next bed who appears to be in much better condition. They tell me he’s her father. Immediately, they answer the question they know I’m thinking. “He used her as a shield during an attack,” they say and continue with their work. I sit there stoking her small hand for a few more minutes before I can continue with my task of bathing her frail body. Lost in sadness as I work to complete my task, I suddenly realize I’m being called to a different bed. I look up and a woman with an Australian accent is asking me for help. I quickly move to the bed where she is standing. Before I can even focus on what is happening, I am holding the man in the bed’s intestines in my hands so they can clean the area around the massive wound in his stomach. I know from my basic first aid class that the organs cannot be put back inside of him in this environment. Instead, I help to hold his intestines securely on the cleaned area and a bandage is placed over the entire stomach to keep it from infection until he can be moved and treated properly. Just then, I hear a groaning sound from the bed behind me. I bring water over to the man who made the sound. He grabs my hand in what feels like desperation. He speaks very quickly in a language I don’t understand. He doesn’t appear to be in pain, but he seems desperate to tell me something. I try explaining that I don’t understand. A staff member comes over and explains to me that UN forces haven’t been able to find an interpreter that speaks his dialect. So, no one knows exactly what he needs. My heart breaks that he is unable to communicate with anyone. He must feel so lonely and scared. I notice a bed at the other end of the room. There is a sheet drawn around it for privacy. They anticipate my question and patiently explain that he is an Iraqi General. They continue by explaining who is in the bed next to the sheeted one and tell me that he is the bomber that caused the chaos that brought all the patients here. His bed is exposed unlike the General’s, but his eyes are covered with a blindfold. I’m not sure what to think about all of this. All I can do is watch the staff in awe as the continue their work. I try to stay out of the way and help in any way I can. The time goes by quickly, and before I know it, my first volunteer shift is over. I know I will volunteer to come back.

          <h2>Haircut</h2>
          <p class="tagline">by Russ Kapp</p>
          <p>
            Following my high school graduation with the senior class of 1965, I enrolled for the fall semester at the Kansas State Teachers College of Pittsburg. I was looking for a smaller and less expensive college to begin my freshman year rather than diving into a more intimidating university setting with larger classes and campus terrain. I arrived prepared to enter the school of liberal arts virtually clueless as to the difference between degree program requirements and the additional requirements necessary to successfully graduate from a land-grant state school. The distinguishing factor that was soon to burst my euphoric bubble of college freshman bliss pivoted on the fact that this type of school’s federal funding mandated that all males take a two-year course in military science in order to successfully graduate. Rack this up to sticker shock or carelessly skipping through a land-grant minefield, since my initial strategy was to somehow avoid the draft after high school. In short, this amounted to a clandestine version of the military draft commonly referred to as the US Army’s ROTC college program.
          </p>
          <p>
            As is often said, the devil is in the fine print. I ask you, how many small-town, soon-to-be college freshmen, fully topped-off with piss and vinegar, are likely to bother reading such micro-font size material, much less, deeply comprehending the meaning of it? Another often quoted nugget of wisdom, which readily applied to my military draft aversion simply goes, “Damned if you do, damned if you don’t.” I had been cornered, and I was fresh out of options by that point. Thus, I turned in my registration (more accurately, resignation) and came out from my mental barricade with both hands held up high, waving my white flag. It would be safe to say that I did not come down from the higher education mountain laughing at any point during my freshman year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Call me simply spoiled or wise, but I called it quits after the spring semester ended. And onward I went to a plan B during the following summer of 1966, exploring and mulling over alternatives to being halfway across the world and a holiday platter turkey by Thanksgiving Day courtesy of a surprise direct-hit mortar attack. Later, as the fall season fast approached, the dreaded clouds of war and blinding dust parted long enough for the descending angels of yore to announce a divine compromise in my fight with this fire-breathing draft dragon. I heard them singing, “For unto you this day, a U.S. Navy recruiter is awaiting your call in the little town of Kansas City. You will find him wrapped in a dress uniform and arriving at your home’s front door.” I henceforth, wasted no time in getting shipshape my plan of action. For the record, military recruiters are the epitome of driven salespersons since they are propelled by the intangible, a quota, instead of the easier sale of material items and money. Meeting the qualifications must be exhaustively rigorous.
          </p>
          <p>
            Being of sharp mind and an impeccable dresser with a sterling silver tongue is just the beginning. Having a quick wit, anticipating questions with nearly instantaneous mind-reading solutions, and possessing the reassurance of a high school guidance counselor who can visualize glamorous future success stories are nearly guaranteed shoo-ins for the ideal military recruiter. After submitting to a regimen of induction testing and screening, I was provisionally selected for a six-year nuclear power technician “career” and designated program. I was immediately zapped into a sleep-walking trance, totally oblivious to another nugget of wisdom: “If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.” Sparing the details of what might have been construed as a bait-and-switch operation, I was suddenly presented with being disqualified from the “Nuke” program due to having corrected vision. Say what? Nevertheless, with no time to reconsider options (I was on my way to boot camp shortly), I gave my body and mind over to a different six-year enlistment program: Electronics Intel and Communications Technician. So be it. With boot camp and several months of introductory electronics schooling under my brass-buckled belt, I arrived at the Bay Area’s Naval Electronics Training Center on Treasure Island during the summer of 1967.
          </p>
          <p>
            As luck would have it and totally unbeknownst to me, this was also the epicenter of the hippies’ Summer of Love with its central headquarters located in the San Francisco Haight-Ashbury District. Having been informed of this happening by a fellow classmate, my eventual first weekend foray offbase was to check out this curious hippie scene. I stepped off the city bus with an astonished look on my face, no doubt. Was I still on planet Earth? I had never witnessed the likes of a massive gathering of freaky young adults and kids. We were encouraged by our naval superiors on base to wear “civies” while on liberty downtown. However, as I surveyed the current scene there at the junction of Haight and Ashbury, I realized I was, in fact, still wearing a uniform of sorts. I was the only one among the throng of beautiful people with a close haircut, a close shave and sporting a pair of men’s slacks and a dress shirt. I was clearly outnumbered, and among the throng of hippies I was, in effect, the only genuinely authentic freak. Nevertheless, this scene became somewhat of a regular weekend destination. Somehow, I knew at the core of my being that I had finally found my tribe and the promised land. It would seem I was becoming a multiple personality disorder case; Clark Kent by day and Superman by night, a sailor in training weekdays and a counterculture warrior on weekends. During my entire stint of classroom training, I was never interrogated as to my whereabouts while on liberty off base. And yet, being aware that my designated military occupation required a full-blown background investigation to obtain the necessary top secret crypto security clearance, I was careful not to participate in any illegal activities while I was out and about. Who knew? Was I being subjected to an undercover watch, basically being shamelessly stalked? Whether that was possible or was merely an over-inflated sense of self-importance, my efforts at staying clean was the best policy given the next level of weekend off-base tribal participation I eventually pursued.
          </p>
          <p>
            The weekend that became a major game-changer during my training stint began in failure. The one time I crossed the line attempting to gain entrance into a pole-dancing bar in California as a minor gave the door bouncers an opportunity to relieve their boredom by flexing some muscle groups. While attempting to fully embrace my disappointment and move on to a potentially bleak weekend, I happened upon on old-style indoor movie theater that had the words, “Avalon Ballroom” on the majestic overhead marquee. I politely asked the ticket booth hippie gal what was currently showing, and she quickly replied in one short breath, “Three bands, three dollars,” with a seemingly take-it-or-leave-it attitude. Clueless as to what I was about to discover, I replied, “Alright by me— here goes.” Once again, I was confronted with my off-base uniform, close haircut, close shave and proper attire, this time in the presence of a New Age audience seated on a bare floor where cinema seating had been previously. A lighthearted festive “vibe” permeated this live music venue with its moving psychedelic light show as a backdrop. I seated myself in a makeshift row close to the stage where a rock band was playing a top-40 song I recognized. As a large woven basket of fresh fruit was passing around and a smoldering joint followed as a chaser, I leaned over to a hippie chick seated next to me and shouted over the din of the loud music, “Dang! Those guys sound just like the Youngbloods.” She turned her pretty face my way and with a look of utter incredulity flatly stated those guys were the Youngbloods! And from then on, the Avalon Ballroom and its cousin, the Winterland Auditorium became weekend alternative duty stations while I was in training to become military spy support.
